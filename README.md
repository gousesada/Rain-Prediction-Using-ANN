# Rain-Prediction-Using-ANN
About this project
This dataset contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from numerous Australian weather stations.

RainTomorrow is the target variable to predict. It means -- did it rain the next day, Yes or No?
This column is Yes if the rain for that day was 1mm or more.

This project uses machine learning to predict rainfall by analyzing weather data. 
By applying an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), the model learns from historical weather patterns like temperature, humidity, and wind speed to forecast future rainfall. 
The project involves cleaning and preparing data, building the ANN model, and evaluating its accuracy through various performance metrics. 
The ultimate goal is to improve weather forecasting using deep learning techniques.
